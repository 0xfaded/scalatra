### core

* Allow `pass` from `methodNotAllowed`

* In ScalatraFilter, the default `methodNotAllowed` handler now delegates to
  the filter chain to look for a matching route.  To restore the previous
  behavior, call:

        doMethodNotAllowed = ScalatraKernel.sendMethodNotAllowed

* Set cookie path to "/" by default in the root context.  It was being
  omitted, which scoped the cookie to the request path.
