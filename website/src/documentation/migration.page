# Migrating from previous versions

## scalatra-2.0.0.M1 to scalatra-2.0.0.M2

1. Session has been retrofitted to a Map interface.  `get` now returns an option instead of the value.
2. ScalaTest support has been split off into `scalatra-scalatest` module.  ScalatraSuite moved to `org.scalatest.test.scalatest` package, and no longer extends FunSuite in order to permit mixing in a BDD trait.  You may either use ScalatraFunSuite or explicitly extend FunSuite yourself.

## Step to Scalatra

Scalatra was renamed from Step to Scalatra to avoid a naming conflict with (an unrelated web framework)[http://sourceforge.net/stepframework].  scalatra-1.2.1 is identical to step-1.2.0 with the following exceptions:

1. The package has changed from `com.thinkminimo.step` to `org.scalatra`.
1. The `Step` class has been renamed to `ScalatraServlet`.
1. All other `Step*` classes have been renamed to `Scalatra*`.
