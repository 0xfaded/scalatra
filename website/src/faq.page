      Why am I getting errors like `foo is not a member of package org.blah`?

      sbt does not update your dependencies before compilation.  Run `sbt update` and then retry your build.

  dt How can I prevent OutOfMemoryErrors in sbt?

      Try changing your sbt shell script, as recommended by the [Lift Wiki](http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/liftweb/Using_SBT):

          java -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled -XX:MaxPermSize=256m -Xmx512M -Xss2M -jar `dirname $0`/sbt-launch.jar "$@"
